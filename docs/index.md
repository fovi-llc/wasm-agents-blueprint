## **Why Wasm Agents?**

This Blueprint bridges the gap between powerful Python AI frameworks and browser-based applications. By running the full OpenAI Agents Python SDK in WebAssembly, you get:

**⚡ Zero Setup:** No server configuration, Docker containers, or complex deployments. Just open an HTML file.

**🛠️ Python Ecosystem:** Access the OpenAI Agents framework with tools, handoffs, and customization.

**🚀 Instant Demos:** See AI agents in action immediately with interactive examples and real-time configuration.

**🔒 Privacy First:** When you hit a local model, your data never leaves your computer. Everything runs client-side.

Whether you're prototyping AI workflows, building educational demos, or creating privacy-focused applications, this Blueprint provides a starting point for browser-based AI agent development.
